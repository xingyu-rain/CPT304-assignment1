Design patterns are considered indispensable tools in modern software development today. They enable developers to craft flexible, maintainable, and reusable solutions that aim to solve similar design problems commonly faced during the development process. Amongst the myriad of patterns developed by the “Gang of Four” (GoF) authors, the Strategy and Decorator patterns have been deemed to be particularly relevant to addressing some of the aforementioned identified challenges. This section aims to critically review the purpose, strengths, and the practical applications of these two patterns to assess their value in mitigating software development’s persistent issues.

The Strategy pattern defines two elements, namely the context and the strategy. The context is the component that contains and controls the executable algorithms and manages the set of attributes or parameters that impacts the execution flow of the algorithms. The client views the context as the entity that is called at compile time to run the algorithm. The strategy contains the interface that are common to different algorithms and the concrete strategy provides its own implementations for the interface. Context decoupling enables modular logic, allowing for the implementation of multiple algorithms with more straightforward implementation and maintainability [1]. The loosely coupled structure permits the client to create a context object instance without prior knowledge of which algorithm is to be used. In addition, it makes it possible for the convenient switching of strategies during runtime. The modular encapsulation of each algorithm makes them interchangeable, allowing the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it [2]. This improves testability as each algorithm can be tested in isolation. This pattern is extensively applied in enterprise systems such as payment processing methods, where algorithm flexibility is especially critical.

The Decorator pattern enables the dynamic addition of responsibilities to objects [3] without structural modification. It serves as an alternative to subclassing to extend functionality [4], thus making such extension of features more maintainable than inheritance [5]. It leverages on composition to wrap objects with new functionality during runtime. This allows for behavioural flexibility without violating encapsulation, hence effective in addressing software complexity and invisibility. The ability to construct complex behaviours through the composition of simple decorators enhances system transparency and modularity. Furthermore, the Decorator pattern supports the ‘Single Responsibility Principle’ through the isolation of each enhancement into individual classes. An example of the pattern in modular software architectures would be to extend object functionality incrementally such as the enhancement of user interface components without modifying its underlying classes.
